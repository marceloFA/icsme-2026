# FixtureDB — Corpus Collection Pipeline

Replication package for the paper:

> **FixtureDB: A Multi-Language Dataset of Test Fixture Definitions from Open-Source Software**  
> João Almeida, Andre Hora  
> *ICSME 2026 — Tool Demonstration and Data Showcase Track*  
> TODO: add DOI once published

This repository contains the extraction pipeline that builds FixtureDB.
The dataset itself (SQLite database + CSV exports) is archived separately
on Zenodo at **TODO: Zenodo DOI**.

## What is FixtureDB?

FixtureDB is a structured dataset of **test fixture definitions** extracted from
open-source software repositories on GitHub across **Python, Java, JavaScript,
TypeScript, Go, and C#**.

A *test fixture* is any code that prepares or tears down state before or after a test runs.
For each fixture, the dataset records structural metadata (size, complexity, scope, type)
and mock framework usage.

**Why it matters:** Prior empirical work on fixtures is exclusively Java-based. FixtureDB is the
first cross-language resource treating the fixture as its primary unit of analysis.

See [docs/01-intro.md](docs/01-intro.md) for the full overview.
