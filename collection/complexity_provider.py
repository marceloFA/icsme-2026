"""
Third-party metric collection for code complexity and structure analysis.

This module wraps industry-standard tools to calculate code metrics across all
5 supported languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go).

METRICS PROVIDED (via Lizard + cognitive-complexity libraries)
=============================================================

- Cyclomatic Complexity: via Lizard library (all languages)
- Cognitive Complexity: via cognitive_complexity library (Python) with fallback formula (other languages)
- Number of Parameters: via Lizard library (all languages) — Phase 2 addition

BENEFITS over custom tree-sitter implementation:
- Uses proven, well-maintained industry-standard libraries
- Consistent with SonarQube and McCabe complexity standards
- Reduces custom code maintenance burden
- Better cross-language consistency
- Academic credibility for published research

See docs/COMPLEXITY_METRICS_MIGRATION.md for complete methodology and justification.
