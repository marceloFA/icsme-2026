# Fixture Detection Logic

**Important Note on Go**: While the collection codebase (`detector.py`, `config.py`) contains Go extraction logic, **Go repositories are NOT included in the published FixtureDB dataset** by design. See [Limitations — Go language exclusion](12-limitations.md#go-language-exclusion) for details. The CSV exports and database contain zero Go data. The detection documentation below covers the implementation of supported languages; Go sections are included for reference only.

Detection is implemented in `collection/detector.py` using
[Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) grammars.
Each language has a dedicated detector function that walks the AST
and matches fixture-defining nodes.

Mock detection is a second pass over the fixture's source text using
compiled regular expressions covering all major mock frameworks per language.
It is intentionally language-agnostic to catch cross-language patterns and
runs after the AST phase.

## Language-specific detectors

### Python

Python fixtures are detected in three forms:

1. **pytest decorator style**: `@pytest.fixture` with scope extraction (`function`, `class`, `module`, `session`)
2. **unittest style**: Methods named `setUp`/`tearDown`/`setUpClass`/`tearDownClass`/`setUpModule`/`tearDownModule` in TestCase subclasses
3. **pytest class methods**: `setup_method()`/`teardown_method()`/`setup_class()`/`teardown_class()` in test classes
4. **nose style**: Module/function-level `setup()`/`teardown()`/`setup_module()`/`teardown_module()` fixtures

The detector properly maps scope levels:
- `function`/`setup_method`/`teardown_method` → `per_test`
- `class`/`setup_class`/`teardown_class` → `per_class`
- `module`/`setUpModule`/`tearDownModule` → `per_module`
- `session` → `global`

### Java

Java fixtures are detected via multiple mechanisms:

1. **JUnit 4 annotations**: `@Before`/`@After`/`@BeforeClass`/`@AfterClass`
2. **JUnit 5 annotations**: `@BeforeEach`/`@AfterEach`/`@BeforeAll`/`@AfterAll`
3. **JUnit 3 legacy**: Plain `setUp()`/`tearDown()` methods (no annotations) in TestCase subclasses
4. **TestNG annotations**: `@BeforeMethod`/`@AfterMethod`/`@BeforeClass`/`@AfterClass`
5. **Test rules**: `@Rule` (method-level, per_test) and `@ClassRule` (class-level, per_class) field declarations

Scope mapping is consistent across frameworks:
- per-test setup: `@Before`, `@BeforeEach`, `@BeforeMethod`, `@Rule` → `per_test`
- per-class setup: `@BeforeClass`, `@BeforeAll`, `@ClassRule` → `per_class`

### JavaScript/TypeScript

JavaScript and TypeScript fixtures are detected via testing framework hook calls:

- **Jest/Mocha/Vitest**: `beforeEach()`, `beforeAll()`, `afterEach()`, `afterAll()` calls
- **Mocha implicit**: `before()`, `after()` (assumes per_test scope)
- **Scope mapping**: 
  - `beforeEach`, `afterEach` → `per_test`
  - `beforeAll`, `afterAll` → `per_class`
  - `before`, `after` → `per_test` (ambiguous without full context)

## Scope Semantics

Fixture scope is standardized across all languages:

- **per_test**: Fixture runs before/after every individual test (most common)
- **per_class**: Fixture runs once per test class/suite (setup for class, teardown after all tests in class)
- **per_module**: Fixture runs once per module/file (Python-specific)
- **global**: Fixture runs once for entire test suite (pytest session scope)

## Mock Detection

Mock usage is detected as a separate pass after fixture extraction using 23+ regex patterns covering:

- **Python**: `unittest.mock`, `pytest-mock`, `MagicMock`, `AsyncMock`
- **Java**: Mockito, EasyMock, MockK (Kotlin)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Jest, Sinon, Vitest

For each mock framework detected, the fixture records:
- Framework name
- Target identifier (if extractable)
- Number of interactions configured (e.g., `.times()`, `.thenReturn()` calls)
- Raw snippet of code for manual inspection

## Fixture Metrics

For each detected fixture, the system computes:

- **LOC** (Lines of Code): Non-blank lines excluding comments

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: McCabe complexity via **Lizard library** (https://github.com/terryyin/lizard)
    - Calculated as: 1 + number of decision points (if, for, while, case, catch)
    - Supported across all 5 languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go)
    - Industry-standard metric used by SonarQube and Codecov

- **Cognitive Complexity**: SonarQube-standard complexity metric
    - **Python**: Calculated via **cognitive-complexity library** (https://github.com/sonarSource/cognitive-complexity)
    - **Other languages**: Formula-based estimate using cyclomatic_complexity × max_nesting_depth
    - Formula: Cognitive Complexity = Σ(nesting_depth) over all control structures
    - Example: three nested if-statements at depths 1, 2, 3 contribute 1+2+3 = 6 to cognitive complexity (vs. cyclomatic complexity of 3)
    - Rationale: Nested code is harder to understand than flat code; nesting depth better reflects human cognitive burden

- **Object Instantiations**: Count of `new Foo(...)` calls and constructor-like calls (custom regex detection)

- **External Calls**: Count of database, HTTP, file I/O, and environment access patterns (custom regex detection for I/O-specific operations)

- **Parameters**: Number of parameters/injection points via **Lizard library** (Phase 2 migration)

- **Max Nesting Depth**: Maximum level of nested block structures (if/for/while/try statements) computed from AST
    - Computed from Tree-sitter AST (per-language)
    - Ranges from 1 (no nesting) to N (deeply nested)
    - Complementary to cognitive complexity: isolates structural nesting independent of control flow decisions
    - Useful for identifying deeply-nested control logic that may indicate code smell

- **Reuse Count**: Number of test functions that use this fixture as a parameter (fixture modularity metric)
    - **Python/pytest**: Counted by scanning test functions for the fixture name in parameter lists
    - **Java/JUnit**: Count of test methods in the same class that share @BeforeEach/@Before fixtures
    - **Other languages**: Heuristic estimate based on scope (per_test = 1, per_class ≥ 1, etc.)
    - Enables Hamster-style fixture modularity analysis: complex fixtures used by many tests have system-wide impact

- **Has Teardown Pair**: Boolean indicating whether fixture has cleanup logic paired with setup
    - **Python/pytest**: Detected by presence of `yield` statement (fixture-style cleanup)
    - **Python/unittest**: `tearDown` method paired with `setUp`, `tearDownMethod` paired with `setupMethod`
    - **Java/JUnit**: `@AfterEach`/`@After` or `@AfterAll`/`@AfterClass` in same class as `@BeforeEach`/`@Before`

    - **Go**: Cleanup registered via `t.Cleanup()` callbacks
    - Indicator of resource cleanup discipline: fixtures without teardown are potential leak indicators

- **Has Yield**: Boolean indicating generator/yield expressions (Python fixtures)

These metrics support fixture quality analysis, modularity studies, and cross-language fixture characterization.

## Limitations and Known Issues

1. **Scope inference limitations** in JavaScript: Dynamically-scoped or conditionally-registered fixtures may be misclassified
2. **Indirect fixture dependencies**: pytest fixtures with `indirect=True` or fixture factories are not tracked
3. **Parametrized test setup**: Multi-run parametrization markers are detected but not correlated with fixtures
4. **Inheritance**: Parent class fixtures in Python/Java/C# are not inferred from super-class analysis
5. **Conditional registration**: Setup code inside if/try blocks or dynamically registered fixtures may be missed

See [Limitations](12-limitations.md) for false-positive and false-negative rates by language.
