# Storage and Scale Estimates

## During collection (temporary)

Each shallow clone occupies roughly 50–200 MB depending on repository size.
With 4 parallel workers the peak transient disk usage is:

```
4 workers × 200 MB = ~800 MB peak during cloning
```

Clones are deleted immediately after extraction, so sustained disk usage
stays low even over a long collection run.

## Final dataset (permanent)

Based on the target collection of ~4,000 searched repos and an expected
~60 % survival rate after filters (~2,400 analysed repos):

| Item                                   | Estimate |
|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| SQLite database (without `raw_source`) | ~150–300 MB |
| SQLite database (with `raw_source`)    | ~1–3 GB |
| All CSV exports (without `raw_source`) | ~80–150 MB |
| Zenodo zip (without `raw_source`)      | ~100–200 MB |

The `raw_source` column dominates storage. The Zenodo deposit excludes it
from CSV by default but includes it in the SQLite file, giving researchers
access to the full fixture text while keeping the primary download size
manageable.
