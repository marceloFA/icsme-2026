# CSV Export Guide

**For CSV users and spreadsheet analysis** — If you need to query the full database or access raw source code, see [Database Schema (SQLite)](../architecture/03-database-schema.md) or [Using the Dataset for Research (SQLite pathways)](../usage/09-usage.md).

This document describes all CSV files exported when running `python pipeline.py export`.

## Excluded Columns (Database-Only)

The following columns exist in the SQLite database but are intentionally excluded from CSV exports:

| Table | Column | Type | Reason |
|-------|--------|------|--------|
| `fixtures` | `category` | TEXT | Internal fixture classification; excluded from public CSV exports |
| `fixtures` | `fixture_type` | TEXT | Qualitative/categorical classification (detection pattern); excluded from CSV (quantitative only) |
| `fixtures` | `has_teardown_pair` | INT | Qualitative cleanup indicator; internal analysis only |
| `mock_usages` | `mock_style` | TEXT | Internal classification (stub, mock, spy, fake); excluded from CSV |
| `mock_usages` | `target_layer` | TEXT | Internal classification (boundary, infrastructure, internal, framework); excluded from CSV |
| `mock_usages` | `raw_snippet` | TEXT | Source code snippet; redundant with fixtures table and SQLite full-text search |

Column names and rationale documented here to clarify schema discrepancies between SQLite and CSV exports.

## Export Structure

The export generates the following CSV files:

```
export/fixturedb_v<version>_<date>/
├── fixtures.db                (full database)
├── repositories.csv           (all repositories)
├── test_files.csv             (all test files)
├── fixtures.csv               (all fixtures)
├── mock_usages.csv            (all mock usages)
├── stats.txt                  (high-level statistics)
└── README.txt                 (schema documentation)
```

## Design Rationale

### CSV Export Strategy

The public CSV exports contain **quantitative metrics only** for this dataset. The full SQLite database includes additional infrastructure columns for reproducibility and future research, but these are intentionally excluded from CSV exports:

**Internal-only fields (excluded from CSV):**
- `category` (fixture) — Internal fixture classification infrastructure; enables future taxonomy work
- `mock_style` (mock usage) — Internal classification (stub/mock/spy/fake) for future analysis
- `target_layer` (mock usage) — Internal classification (infrastructure layers) for future analysis

**Source code (excluded from CSV):**
- `raw_source` (fixture) — Full source text is bulky; available in SQLite for researchers who need it
- `raw_snippet` (mock usage) — Code snippet redundant with github_url pointing to exact location

### Design principles

1. **Quantitative focus:** CSV exports contain only measurable, objective facts (LOC, counts, metrics)
2. **Reproducible:** Full SQLite database available for verification of extraction decisions
3. **Traceable:** github_url enables verification of any finding directly in source code
4. **Archivable:** Zenodo deposit includes both SQLite (for transparency and future research) and CSV (for paper analysis)
